# ChallengeOne_MM

## Overview of Project
The overview of this challenge is to help Louise know how many different campaigns have fared in their relation to their launch date and fundraising goals by using the Kickerstarter challenge provided to us in Module 1. 

## Analysis and Challenges
Some of the challenges I have encountered with this challenge were getting the =COUNTIFS to work. At first, it was hard to code to the less than or equal to and the greater than or equal to on excel. I would fix it by watching the example video on the assignment and I would also mess around with the code. I also would notice that the number were way too high. 

Another problem I had with the COUNTIF's was that I would put in the wrongs. Instead of putting the goals column in the code, I would accidently put the pledged columns. While messing around with excel, I learned that while coding COUNTIF's on a different worksheet, I could click the sheet on I want to do the countif and it would record the code and then click on the column. It just took some research and asking for help that I was able to get the epected results.

## Results
### Theater Outcomes By Launch Dates
My analysis of the the Theater Outcomes By Launch Dates is that around May and June, plays tends to be more successful. Another Analysis is that plays dont get canceled as much. The month with the most canceled shows are in July. 

### Outcomes Based on Goals
Louis almost reached her fundraising goal for fever. She wanted to look at other campaigns to see how they fared in their relation to their launch date and fundraising goals. We created a table to help her visualize the number campaigns that were successful, failed canceled. According to the data, shows are more likely to fail to reach their fundraising goals.
